# School System Data Aggregation API - Project Report

## Overview

This project is a Node.js API that aggregates data from a MongoDB database related to a school system. It provides an endpoint for obtaining summaries such as the total number of students, average student age, and the total number of classes offered.

## Architecture

### Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

### Project Structure

|-- app.js
|-- models/
| |-- student.js
| |-- class.js
|-- routes/
| |-- api.js
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
|-- report.md

This project contains the following files in the main branch :
-index.js
-README.md
-package-lock.json
-package.json

and the following directory
-models

models folder contains the folowing files which defines the schema for each model

-classModel.js
-studentModel.js
-teacherModel.js


## Challenges Faced

1. **Database Connection:**
   - Connecting the app to an existing database
   - Establishing relations between collections

## Future Improvements

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Add user authentication and authorization for secure API access.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement more robust error handling to provide better feedback to users.

3. **Enhanced Data Summaries:**
   - Include additional data summaries based on user feedback.

## Summary

### Approach
The project involves building a Node.js application to interact with a MongoDB database. The primary goal is to retrieve and display all documents in a specific collection. The approach follows these key steps:

Connect to MongoDB: Establish a connection to the MongoDB database using the official MongoDB Node.js driver.

Access Collection: Access the desired collection within the database where documents need to be retrieved.

Create and endpoint : To display summary

Challenges:
Several challenges were encountered during the development of the Node.js project:

Connection Handling: Managing the MongoDB connection lifecycle, ensuring proper connection establishment, and handling errors during the connection process.

Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to address potential issues during database interactions, such as network errors or invalid queries.

Solutions:
To address the challenges mentioned above, the following solutions were implemented:

Connection: Utilizing instructions provided by the MongoDB Node.js driver to efficiently manage database connections and improve performance.

Error Handling Middleware: Implementing middleware functions to capture and handle errors, providing informative messages and graceful degradation in case of unexpected issues.

Conclusion:
The project successfully implemented a Node.js application to interact with MongoDB, demonstrating the ability to retrieve and display all documents in a collection. The solutions applied addressed key challenges, ensuring a reliable and efficient database interaction process. Ongoing improvements and optimizations will be considered to enhance the overall performance and maintainability of the system.
